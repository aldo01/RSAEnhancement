enhanced rsa

The RSA public key and signature scheme is often used in modern communications technologies; it is one of the
firstly defined public key cryptosystem that enable secure communicating over public unsecure communication
channels. 

ENHANCING THE SECURITY OF THE RSA CRYPTOSYSTEM uses the extra k factor to encrypt the message, including padding bits.

Enhancing the security of the RSA cryptosystem
The key generation remain unchanged as in the original RSA. The following algorithms describe the
enhanced RSA cryptosystem.
Algorithm :

To run, import the project in the net beans, and run the application, it is  having java swing gui for easy encryption and decryption.
